# Device Info Web Application

This is a lightweight web application built with PHP that provides detailed information about a user's device and server. It displays real-time data such as disk space, memory usage, processor details, operating system, battery status, browser information, screen size, and more.

---

## Features

- **Disk Space**: View total and free disk space in GB.
- **RAM Usage**: Displays total and used RAM (Linux only).
- **CPU Cores**: Number of processor cores on the server.
- **Server OS**: Detailed operating system information of the server.
- **Battery Status**: Displays battery level and charging status.
- **Browser Info**: Shows browser user agent details.
- **Screen Size**: Detects the user's screen dimensions.
- **Device Type**: Identifies the user's device as mobile, tablet, or desktop.
- **Location Detection**: Fetches geolocation data (latitude and longitude) if permission is granted.
- **Download Device Info**: Export device details as JSON.

---

## How It Works

- **Backend (PHP)**:
  - Gathers server-side details like disk space, RAM, CPU cores, and OS using PHP functions and shell commands (Linux servers only).
- **Frontend (JavaScript)**:
  - Uses browser APIs to fetch battery status, screen size, and geolocation.
  - Dynamic and responsive interface styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4 or later
- Linux-based server (for accurate RAM and CPU information)
- A modern web browser for frontend features
